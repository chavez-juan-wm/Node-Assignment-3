# Node-Assignment-3

In this assignment you will continue the exploration of user authentication. We have already set up the REST API server to validate an ordinary user. Now, you will extend this to verify an Admin and grant appropriate privileges to an Admin. At the end of this assignment, you would have completed the following:

<ul>
    <li>Check if a verified ordinary user also has admin privileges.</li>
    <li>Allow an ordinary user to only perform GET operations</li>
    <li>Allow only an Admin to perform POST, PUT and DELETE operations</li>
    <li>Allow an Admin to be able to GET all the registered users' information from the database</li>
<ul>
